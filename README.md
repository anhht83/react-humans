# React coding-challenges
The task is to create a simple frontend-only clone of https://humans.io using React and Redux. This is a little project built by our CEO a few years ago. The basic functionality is to add/edit/delete humans. You can use a UI library like Bootstrap or Semantic UI to make it look nice.

## Platform/Boilerplate
This project was bootstrapped with [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate).

## Fake APIs to store data in localStorage

The fake Apis defined in <containers>/fakeApis.js files

### `npm install` 
To download the dependencies packages

### `npm run start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
